TODO
====

v1
--
[x] fix current scaling issue
[x] extend keypress to set datum and calibration points as well
[x] after setting calibration points set window.focus
[x] Change sig figs for regression
[x] Move the datum button the point 1 calibration menu
[x] Remove pixel locations, nobody cares ;)
[x] show datum immediately after setting it

CORE
[ ] Set datum y-value isn’t working -- investigate when a user sets a non 0,0 datum and how that affects the calculated points
[ ] Add pdf support
[ ] allow rotation of the image with butons/hotkeys

RESIZING
[ ] refactor x,y coords in series
[x] refactor datum
[x] refactor calibration
[ ] Draw a frame around the canvas & make it resizable live

UX
[ ] show x,y location of cursor when moving
[ ] finish clear series button highlighting stuff
[ ] reset datum and calibration on upload image
[ ] show marker when setting calibration point
[ ] layer inconsisency for markers and regressions on listner events (point list and mouseover/mouseout of canvas)
[ ] Don’t allow +/- to change zoom when zoombox is not active (i.e. mouse not over canvas, zoombox button not checked)
[ ] Remove default as graph
[ ] on load load the default state of datum and scale into the ui
[ ] User selection for colors (crosshairs, datum, markers, highlighted marker)

SCALING
[ ] small images are stretched (adjust the zoomScale factor based on the native sizes compared to canvas size, use a factor of 2 of wahtever that ratio is)
[ ] ensure images loaded with diff aspect ratios will work
[ ] Scaling edge-cases https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21961839/simulation-background-size-cover-in-canvas/21961894#21961894
[ ] large images seem to work, do more testing

REFACTOR
[ ] normalize use of getting datum by function

PUMP SPECIFIC
[ ] add affinity law scaling and other pump data entry things such as speed


v2
--
[ ] Mouseover points should highlight them, not just mouseover the X
[ ] Add event listener when default canvas state no graph to click to load a graph
[ ] add clearCalbration function which resets the ui elements and clears the calibration table, erases the datum, etc
[ ] populate the refreshGraph function
[ ] refactor everything
[ ] recomment
[ ] improve ui
[ ] warn user if calibration point is too close to datum (x/y axis)?
[ ] Add multiple series
